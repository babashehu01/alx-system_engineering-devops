# 0x0B-ssh

Along with this project, we have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, I will connect using ssh. But contrary to level 2, I  will not be  connecting using a password but an RSA key. Theyâ€™ve configured my server with the public key I created in the first task of a previous project.
